# Problem 10

This Java program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion and the Euclidean Algorithm.

## Instructions

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the `Problem10GCDRecursive.java` file using a Java compiler.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled program.
   - Enter the values of the two numbers when prompted.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will output the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `gcd` method is O(log min(a, b)), where a and b are the input numbers. This is because the Euclidean Algorithm reduces the problem size by at least half in each step.
